Rust-- (rustmm)

Language
In the first place was meant to be subset of the Rust language
(https://www.rust-lang.org/), but eventually it is a little bit different.
Features: expression based, functions as values (can be arguments and returned
from functions), closures which remember their environment, references,
mutability

Parser
Written in MegaParsec (https://github.com/mrkkrp/megaparsec).

Static Checks
Types, mutability, taking refs.

AST & Eval
I tried to keep AST minimalistic. All operators and while are desugarated
to calls to builtins. I don't support generics, so if is actually present
in AST since I need to check if both branches returns same type.

Building (including students machine)
Locally - with cabal.
On students - I'm having problems.
